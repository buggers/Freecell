Freecell. No frills. Not even a redeal button.

In honor of my dad -- this is the only computer game he'll play.

Future development plan

 *Add deal button so you can replay if you have no moves left
     -Don't auto-exit upon win.

 * Double clicking a playstack button moves it to a freecell
 * Auto-move of stacks if cells are available
 * Auto-move of aces and other cards when it would have no detrimental
game impact
 * Better graphics
      Different cards
      Drag icon should be the same as a card (mark the button invisible then set
	drag icon to equal the card icon)
      Selection visibility on a PC is not good -- color should be green.
 * Optional: Card moving animation when cards are moved via selection
 * Add testing
 
Known bugs
 * -Default onClickPressed flash animation still present.
 * -Empty stack shows a phantom card when cards are moved via selection
(but not when moved by drag and drop)

Version 0.20
 * Cards are now movable.
