Freecell. No frills. Not even a redeal button.

Extra credit assignment for class. In honor of my dad -- this is the only computer game he'll play.

Improvements to come:

 *Add deal button so you can replay if you have no moves left
     -Don't auto-exit upon win.
 * -Make buttons moveable. This might require a redesign. Hence do it first.
 * -Double clicking a playstack button moves it to a freecell
 * -Auto-move of stacks if cells are available
 * -Auto-move of aces and other cards when it would have no detrimental
 * game impact
 * -Add testing
 * -Better graphics
 * -Card moving animation
   -Check selection visibility on a PC.
